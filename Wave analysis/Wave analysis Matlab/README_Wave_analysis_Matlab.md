The main file is called ‘PabloScript.m’. In this file the procedure is written. It uses two functions (that use other functions again):

- createCellData: Finds all good traces and gives the data, and analysis of the data in one structure (this is called ‘CellData’ in PabloScript)
- getPabloData: Finds the data that you need from the data of the good cells, and puts this in ‘CycleData’
- PabloData structure gets the information that you actually want.
